# TSRPC

A TypeScript RPC framework with runtime type checking and binary encoding.

## Features
- Runtime type checking
- Binary encoding based on TypeScript type definition
- HTTP, WebSocket, and more protocols supported
- JSON compatible, prune excess properties automatically
- High performance and stable, verified by billions of online users

## Usage
Docs and examples are coming soon...

## Serialization Algorithm
The best TypeScript serialization algorithm ever.
Without any 3rd-party IDL language (like protobuf), it is fully based on TypeScript source file. Define the protocols directly by your code.

This is powered by [TSBuffer](https://github.com/tsbuffer), which is going to be open-source.

TypeScript has the best type system, with some dynamic features like union type, intersection type, mapped type, etc.
This may be the only serialization algorithm that support all of them.

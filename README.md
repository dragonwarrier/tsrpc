# TSRPC

A TypeScript RPC framework with runtime type checking and binary serialization.

## Features
- Runtime type checking
- Binary serialization
- Pure TypeScript, without any decorater or other language
- HTTP / WebSocket / and more protocols...
- Optional backward-compatibility to JSON
- High performance and reliable, verified by services over 100,000,000 users

## Usage
Docs and examples are coming soon...

## Serialization Algorithm
The best TypeScript serialization algorithm ever.
Without any 3rd-party IDL language (like protobuf), it is fully based on TypeScript source file. Define the protocols directly by your code.

This is powered by [TSBuffer](https://github.com/tsbuffer), which is going to be open-source.

TypeScript has the best type system, with some unique advanced features like union type, intersection type, mapped type, etc.

TSBuffer may be the only serialization algorithm that support them all.
